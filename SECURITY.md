## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Kelvin API Wrapper, we take security seriously and appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing any security vulnerabilities you may find.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Use GitHub's Private Reporting:** We encourage you to use GitHub's built-in private vulnerability reporting feature to report security issues. This allows you to securely share the details with us while keeping the information confidential.

2. **Wait for Our Response:** We will acknowledge your report and work to verify and address the vulnerability promptly. We may request additional information or clarification from you.

3. **Security Updates:** Once we have verified and fixed the vulnerability, we will release a security update. We will also provide credit to the reporter, if desired.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you practice responsible disclosure when reporting security vulnerabilities to us. This means:

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have addressed it.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability for any malicious purposes.
- Provide us with reasonable time to investigate and address the issue.

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and will keep you informed throughout the process.

## Attribution

We want to thank all security researchers and contributors who help us maintain the security of Kelvin API Wrapper. Your responsible disclosure is greatly appreciated.
